# TV-regularization-hyperspectral

Code related to "Collaborative Total Variation Regularization of Hyperspectral Images", Bachelor's Thesis done in 2015 during an Erasmus stay at TUM, for my Bachelors degree in Informatics Engineering.

This project uses the Hyperspectral toolbox: http://www.censsis.neu.edu/software/hyperspectral/hyperspectral.html

# Disclaimer
This code is uploaded "as is", as it was done 5+ years ago, so it probably is broken, dirty and with multiple issues. Someday maybe I go back and fix it and make it presentable, but the probability of that happening soon is close to null.
